 Why do we need different layouts?

In most real apps you have different types of pages:

Public pages (like Home, About, Contact, Login) → same header/footer, visible to everyone.

Protected pages (like Dashboard, Profile, Settings) → visible only when signed in, usually with a sidebar or different navigation.

Authorization pages (like Login, Register, Forgot Password) → often minimal layout, without the main header/footer.

Instead of repeating headers/footers everywhere, we wrap them in layouts.
