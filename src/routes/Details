1. Typical route categories in a project
ðŸ”¹ Public routes (no login required)

/ â†’ HomePage

/about â†’ AboutPage

/contact â†’ ContactPage

ðŸ‘‰ These pages are wrapped with PublicLayout (header + footer visible).

ðŸ”¹ Auth routes (for authentication flow)

/sign-in â†’ SignInPage

/sign-up â†’ SignUpPage

/forgot-password â†’ ForgotPasswordPage

ðŸ‘‰ These are wrapped in AuthLayout (usually minimal, no main navbar/footer, just a centered card).

ðŸ”¹ Protected routes (login required)

/dashboard â†’ DashboardPage

/profile â†’ ProfilePage

/settings â†’ SettingsPage

ðŸ‘‰ These use ProtectedLayout (often has a sidebar, different navigation).

If the user is not signed in, they get redirected to /sign-in.
